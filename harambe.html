<p><em>Gone too soon</em></p>

<p>
  The Harambe Meme was but a brief flicker of light in an otherwise dim and sullen memescape in 2016. Over-memeing and the overall carelessness of the meme community led to the Harambe meme's untimeley demise in mid-2016. Like other short lived memes before it (Dat Boi, namely), the Harambe meme seemed to offer some semblance of purpose and hope to the typically jaded meme community. Why the Harambe meme took such an abrupt nose dive is unclear, but one thing is for certain: its impact will never be forgotten.
