Yesterday was the first day of the second week of regular season play in the North American LCS, and Team Impulse pulled off quite an upset against Cloud 9 while fielding a roster of mostly substitute players. Team Impulse played with Seraph, BeiBei, Gate, Mash, and Ken against C9's roster of Balls, Rush, Jensen, Sneaky, and BunnyFuFu at support for this game. TIP was expecting to play with subs until their import players could get visa and travel issues sorted out, but their top laner from last week, Feng, was not able to play this week for whatever reason, so TIP brought in Seraph. Seraph currently plays in the Challenger Series for Team Arena Online with a few other Korean players like Ninja as well as some well known names like Bischu.

The big question for C9 this game was, just like it was on W1D1, can they perform without Hai on the roster? C9 is utilizing an active six man roster, subbing in Hai for BunnyFuFu when necessary, as they groom Bunny to replace Hai. C9 struggles without the intense, micromanagement focused shot calling style of Hai, though, and they look lost without their in game leader. This issue of disorganization seems exacerbated by a somewhat reckless and risky player like Rush, whose early game invades and playmaking can cost the team if they're not playing cohesively.

I'd like to make this post primarily about C9's shortcomings in the draft phase against TIP, however. C9's roster struggle deserves its own post, and we haven't seen enough of them this season to say too much.

Onto the draft phase for this game, then. Let's start with the bans. For this game, TIP was on the blue side, and C9 was on the red side.

**TIP Bans**: Thresh, Tahm Kench, Alistar

**C9 Bans**: Graves, Gangplank, Ryze

So TIP comes right out with a clear strategy of knocking BunnyFuFu off of a play-making support that he's comfortable on. Bunny is known as a talented Thresh player, and Alistar is a champion that shot calling supports seem to like a lot for his versatility and his ability to force engages. The Tahm Kench ban just a general power pick ban. Tahm has been seeing play mostly in the top lane because of his ability to punish tanks and his global pressure, but it's not a champion that fits Seraph's play style at all. Seraph tends to play pretty exclusively carry and mage top laners, so TIP would rather take away the Tahm than play against it.

C9's bans are pretty typical of red side teams on 6.1. It doesn't seem like they had any plans to try and trade OP picks or anything like that, they'd rather just ban three power picks and look to pick up some comfort picks on their first rotation. Graves is extremely strong in both the top lane and jungle, Gangplank is still strong after repeated nerfs, and Ryze has been picked over and over again in all regions to a lot of success.

So the ban phase goes without a hitch, really, TIP gets to ban Bunny out a little bit, and C9 knocks out some power picks from their slightly disadvantaged position on the red side. I think C9 could have maybe tried to put some ban pressure on Gate and look to trade an OP instead. I don't think Rush or Balls have Graves ready for the LCS stage at this point though, and perhaps that throws a wrench in C9's ban phase.

The pick phase is a much different story, however, and I think C9 really dropped the ball here.

**TIP Picks**: Lulu, Lee Sin/Braum, Lucian/Lissandra

**C9 Picks**: Kalista/Nidalee, Shen/Trundle, Ezreal

TIP first picks Lulu for Gate, which I would consider a comfort pick for him. He played Lulu five times in the 2015 summer playoff, and even though he went 1-4, I'd still consider this a safe pick for Gate. C9 then locks in Kalista and Nidalee for their first picks.

Pro teams need to stop picking Nidalee.

Nidalee is a fallback pick for a lot of pro players because they have a lot of success in solo queue on the champion, I think. She doesn't really work on the pro stage though because she offers literally zero utility. Her only real advantage over other junglers is her insanely fast clear speed, which gives her the ability to invade the enemy jungle and make cheesey counterjungle plays. However, Nidalee is just dead weight in the mid and late and game, offering absolutely no utility. Her kit gives her only damage, and she has absolutely no CC. A champion like Lee Sin, who TIP locks with Braum in their second rotation of picks, offers similar early game pressure to Nidalee, but is able to actually provide meaningful peel or initiation in the mid/late game. Lee Sin also has the benefit of transitioning into a tank build as his early game damage falls off, where Nidalee just has to build AP the entire game. TIP locks in Braum, as well. With Alistar and Thresh both being banned, TIP just wants to pick up an A-tier support early to hide which lane their Lulu is taking until their last two picks.

C9's second round of picks is the biggest question mark of this draft phase. They lock Shen and Trundle. I think the intention of Lemonnation (C9's on-stage coach for picks and bans) here is to lock in two flex picks. Shen and Trundle, in C9's eyes, can both fill either the top lane or support role. However, top Trundle on 6.1 has not been very popular in the top lane as he took a few nerfs, so I don't think he should be considered a flex pick at all for the time being. So, with Trundle basically being confirmed for the support role, we're left with Balls taking Shen in the top lane. Shen top is not in a good place right now, and if you follow Saintvicious on Twitter you will see that he dies a little bit every time a team takes Shen top. I think Shen is similar to Nidalee for some top laners in that when they don't know what to pick or they're forced to blind pick, they take Shen. Shen was, for a while at least, a sort of neutralizing top laner who went even in pretty much every lane, but that is no longer the case. With champions like Tahm Kench, Fiora, and Graves making their mark on top lane, Shen really can't stand up to that many popular picks anymore. The Shen and Trundle picks were huge blunders on C9's part in this draft, and I think they put themselves in a huge hole because of them.

TIP rounds out their draft with Lucian and Lissandra for Mash and Seraph respectively. Lucian has been the most picked marksman across all regions on this patch because he has a very good power curve with items like Essence Reaver and Rapid Fire Cannon. Lucian also does very well in lane with Braum support. Lissandra is a pick that I'm surprised to see fall so far down in the draft. A lot of teams put into C9's position would have taken Lissandra over Shen in their second round. Lissandra is a much better flex pick than Shen on this patch, since she can comfortably lane top or mid. Lissandra also does very well against squishies and teams with a high number of back line champions (marksman, long range mages, etc), which are popular in the current meta. Lissandra doesn't actually lane that well into Shen, and we see that play out as Balls actually chunks Seraph on multiple occasions and is able to pretty much neutralize Lissandra's laning ability. However, through good TP usage, Seraph is able to make numerous flanks onto C9's back line, so the Lissandra pick was huge for TIP's win here.

C9's last pick is Ezreal for Jensen in the mid lane. Mid Ezreal is just *okay* in my opinion. There are better marksmen to put in the mid lane, most notably Corki, but Ezreal does have a place on siege comps. C9's goal with the Ezreal mid is to take advantage of his Iceborn Gauntlet spike and group up to siege down some towers. Between the Ezreal poke, the Nidalee spears, Trundle pillars, and the two marksmen, they should, on paper, be able to take down turrets very easily in the mid game.

TIP's composition is very well rounded, though. After seeing the Trundle pick, they decide to run no tank, which actually eliminates a big reason for picking Trundle - his ultimate. Trundle's ultimate is crucial in shredding down tanks, since it steals such a large percentage of resistances, but without any enemy champions stacking resistances, Trundle doesn't really get to shine in that regard. TIP also gets the benefit of having really good backline access with Lissandra into two squishy marksman and a squishy Nidalee. C9 picking double marskmen into Lissandra is another big question mark for me in this draft, since Lissandra will always have a target to ult until both marksmen *and* Nidalee have QSS. Even when those champions all have QSS, Seraph can still find good ultimates on himself and create a large, heavily slowing zone for his team to pile onto C9's backline.

Overall, C9 dropped the ball on this draft. The Trundle and Shen picks in C9's second round of the draft were absolute blunders, and the Ezreal last pick was a bad idea into a team that had already locked in Lissandra. TIP's upset of C9 was definitely shocking, but looking at the draft I think C9 deserved to lose this game.
