Hi there. I'm a 22 year old web developer/software engineer located in Lancaster, PA. I'm a recent graduate of Millersville University and I currently work for Clipper Magazine as a backend web applications developer. My primary project is [localflavor.com](https://localflavor.com), and I work primarily in the services and heavy backend realm of things. Currently, I'm working towards migrating our existing .NET stack to a Rails stack, so I'll be documenting some of the things I learn along the way. Thanks for reading!
