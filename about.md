Hi there. I'm a 22 year old web developer/software engineer located in Lancaster, PA. I'm a recent graduate of Millersville University and I am currently the Lead Backend Developer for Clipper Magazine in Mountville, PA. My primary project is [localflavor.com](www.localflavor.com), but I am actively involved in several other projects - primarily creating API's and smaller projects in Node.js.
