Hello! My name is Kyle Pollich, and I am a 23 year old software engineer located in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. I graduated from Millersville University in 2015 with a degree in Computer Science. Since I graduated, I've been working as a developer at Clipper Magazine in Mountville, PA where I work as the lead backend developer. I work in C# .NET, Ruby on Rails, and Node.js - primarily on backend services and REST API's.

I'm also a hobby programmer, and I love dabbling in new technology when I can. In my free time, I've been learning React.js and honing my front end skills.

When I'm not writing code, I'm an avid guitarist and drummer as well as a huge fan of esports. You can usually catch me on weekends watching League of Legends or Counter Strike tournaments, or playing some competitive strategy games myself. Or you might find me relaxing with my wife Alex and our rambunctious cat Sterling.

I'm always open to hearing about new opportunities or experiences, and you can find an online version of my resume [here](/resume). If you'd like a more professional resume or to open a line of contact, feel free to email me at [kpollich1@gmail.com](mailto:kpollich1@gmail.com).
